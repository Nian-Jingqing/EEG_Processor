In this section you'll see how you can edit the name of a file and visualy inspect its contents.

==============
Edit file name
==============

The name of a file in the BIDS structure is determined by a set of stringent `rules and specifications <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/02-common-principles.html#file-name-structure>`_. The filename is build-up of ``key`` and ``value`` pairs, separated by dashes (-), and these key-value pairs are concatenated by underscores (_).

- In the middle right "File" tab, use the dropdown menus and the input fields to change the filename. You will notice that the file in the files-tree will now show (unsaved) behind its name. 
- Use the "Save" button to confirm these changes, at which point the actual file-on-disk will be renamed. Or use the "Undo" button to revert back to the original filename.

====================
Delete a single file
====================

- Select a single file in the files-tree in the left center tab.
- Use the "Delete file" button to delete the file.
